# YOUR NAME Human User Guide
The goal of a human user guide is to make working together and collaboration with colleagues easier, faster. The focus for this user guide is on the workplace. As such, many of the questions are geared towards information that would be pertinent to your colleagues.

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
- I am situationally introverted until I get comfortable with people. I tend to lurk in the
background of meetings more than 4 people where I don't have a (virtual) microphone. Give me a spotlight, however... :microphone:
- I value efficient use of everyone's time. I *love* ending meetings early when we've accomplished what we set out to achieve in our time together.
- I learn best by first seeing then having a direct application.

### What drives you nuts?
- Meeting invites without an agenda, supporting docs, or a defined outcome.
- Doing something in a less than ideal way. If you know a tip / trick / or hack, please let me in on the secret!
- Apps that don't do dark mode :sunglasses:

### What are your quirks?
- Some times I won't try new things unless I'm sure I can nail it. I'm working on being
comfortable with failing and learning.
- I'm fidget with my hands! Paper clips, alligator clips, drumming on surfaces.
- I try to be a ruthless self-editor in writing. You're as like as not to see (edited) by my Slack messages. An english teacher in high school called me out on excessive written decoration, so I type, edit, delete, redo, and finally hit send. Thanks, Miss Hughes :eyes:.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
- I can be quiet, but that doesn't mean I don't want to party! Invite me in the conversation.
- I'm an optimizer, not a perfectionist. Generally, I'm in the "perfect is the enemy of good" camp, and different projects have different tolerances.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
- I love it when people intentionally reach out to include someone else whether that be in a project, conversation, or joke.
- I like when your expectations of me are clear and you don't mind speaking up when you're unsure if I'm picking up what you're putting down.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
- Tell inside jokes that they don't have intention of explaining.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
- People can earn an extra gold star with me by setting expectations and delivering on those. If something changes, just let me know! We're all rowing the same boat.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
- I really enjoy understanding what makes people tick and asking them to explain what makes them excited. By teaching or explaining to me, I encourage them to be sure they fully grasp the problem or task at hand.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
- I prefer Slack over most mediums. If we're meeting in person, I like a defined outcome for the meeting.
- I enjoy meetings that are <30 minutes if possible.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
- The best way to convince me to do something is tell me why it matters to you personally or the org at large.

### How do you like to give feedback?
- I try to ask permission first, state my observation, and get agreement that we observed the same thing before giving my take.
- I like the feedback to be actionable. I'm forgiving on things that I know aren't the typical *you*, and I'm willing to see if it's a trend instead of an anomaly.

### How do you like to get feedback?
- If you notice I'm doing something that could be done in a faster, more efficient, or more complete way, please, PLEASE tell me.
- I appreciate earnest and constructive feedback. Tell me your observation, the result, and how I can do better next time.
- I prefer serious feedback in private. If it's something that could benefit the entire org and isn't deeply personal, I don't mind receiving it in front of an audience.
