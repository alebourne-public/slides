## What are some honest, unfiltered things about me?

- I tend to be quiet and not to say much until I build rapport with others, then I am very outgoing.
- I tend to say Yes to many things. Sometimes taking on too many things. I am working on learning to say No.
- My communication style is generally clear and direct. Except when I have something negative to say, it will probably not be very direct. I try not to be rude so I tend to keep things to myself. Especially if they are not positive. So if I am very quiet, it may be that things are not going well. I am working on this, but it is a process.
- I like to work independently and do not like to be micromanaged. Instead make me believe in the mission. I am a person who takes pride in what I do, and expect others to trust and respect me.

- I work best with folks who are respectful, open minded and kind.
- Sometimes I may say “I don’t know about this…” that actually means “I do not think this is a good idea”.

- 
## What drives me nuts? 

- I do not like to be mansplained or to be talked down to. Treat me equally.
- Being opaque or vague. I interpret this as disrespectful of time and effort invested. I would much prefer direct bad news, or a no, than double-speak. 
- Being manipulated. Lied to.
- Meetings that could have been an email or a Slack message. I try not to have too many meetings as part of my organizational design. I respect your time, and expect that in return.

- Kindness and respect. We spend most of our waking hours at work. Let’s be kind to each other.
